##Overview
This repository contains scripts that reproduce results in the manuscript "A thermodynamic framework for modelling membrane transporters".

##MATLAB
The MATLAB directory contains scripts that reproduce the figures in the manuscript. The live script `MATLAB/code/main_script.mlx` will generate all figures when run. A `.m` version of the live script can be found at `MATLAB/code/main_script_m.m`.

##CellML
The CellML directory contains CellML code for the models described in the manuscript, and SED-ML files that generate some of the figures.
