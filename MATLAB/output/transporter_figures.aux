\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces \textbf  {Coupled transport.} In order for a transporter to move a substrate against a concentration gradient, it must couple the transport to a process that generates sufficient energy for the transport to occur. Here we model a transporter that couples the transport of substrate to another biochemical reaction $\mathrm  {A \rightleftharpoons  B}$, giving rise to the overall reaction $ \mathrm  {S_i} + A \rightleftharpoons  \mathrm  {S_e} + B$. We simulate this system to steady state. The plots show that the amount of A affects the ability of the transporter to move a substrate against a chemical gradient, shifting the equilibrium point to a higher concentration of Se \textbf  {(A)} and increasing the cycling rate \textbf  {(B)}. \textbf  {(C)} By modelling this system as a bond graph, fundamental thermodynamic constraints are captured, therefore the pump only operates in the direction of decreasing chemical potential, and stops cycling at equilibrium.\relax }}{3}}
\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces \textbf  {Electrogenic transport.} Many transporters, including ion transporters, move charged species across a membrane that is charged. For these transporters, the membrane potential contributes to the thermodynamics and kinetics of the system. Because bond graphs are domain-independent, they are able to model the interaction between chemical and electrochemical power in electrogenic systems. Here we simulate the transporter model $\mathrm  {E_1 + S_i^+ \rightleftharpoons  E_2 \rightleftharpoons  E_2 + S_e^+}$, where the substrate is charged. \textbf  {(A)} A plot of the cycling rate against voltage shows the bond graph model captures the equilibrium point (Nernst potential) of this transporter. \textbf  {(B)} The membrane voltage has a linear contribution to the Gibbs free energy of the transporter. \textbf  {(C)} Plotting cycling rate against Gibbs free energy verifies that the equilibrium point corresponds to a Gibbs free energy of zero.\relax }}{4}}
